# Kernel.js Presets

Kernel.js is a very composable library thanks to building on top of Viem and Permissionless.  However, that also means that it can sometimes feel like you need to write a lot of boilerplate code before you can get something going.

**Presets** are helper functions that will help you set up Kernel accounts based on the most common configurations.  [Check out Kernel.js docs to learn more.](https://docs.zerodev.app/kerneljs/core-api/create-account)
